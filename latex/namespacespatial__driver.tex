These objects drive the solution of the spatial part of the P\+DE problem.  




\subsection{Detailed Description}
These objects drive the solution of the spatial part of the P\+DE problem. 

The spatial part of the problem corresponds to the right hand side of the differential equation du/dt = f( u, d$^\wedge$(n)u/dx$^\wedge$(n), d$^\wedge$(n)u/dy$^\wedge$(n) )

The Spatial\+Driver is called by the main driver class and itself calls the problem class and the boundary handler objects in order to return an approximation for the values of the right hand side to the data logger object.
